# React TypeScript Tic-Tac-Toe

## Features

- React and Typescript

- Using `webpack` for the build

- Responsive web app

## Quick Start

Have webpack installed globally to use webpack
- `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli`

### Develop

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

Open `index.html` file located in ./src
- `start ./src/index.html` or `open ./src/index.html`, depending on the OS

**Note**: Dependencies in /dist and /src `index.html` files have different source links. 

### Quick Dev Start

- `npm install`
- `npm run devstart`

### Build and run

- `npm run build`
- Deploy and serve static files (e.g. using `pushstate-server`)

**Note**: Build only updates JS and CSS in the /dist folder (not html).

## Update GitHub pages

`git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
